Wrapper of IF97 for MathCAD 15
==================================

Has been developed and tested on Mathcad 15.0 (any maintenance release).  May work on earlier versions, but it has not been tested there.

To Use
======

* Compile in VS2010 or later using the solution and project files

* Copy the if97.dll file to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mathcad\\Mathcad 15\\userefi or equivalent for your version (this will be done automatically by the project)  
  
* Copy the IF97_EN.xml to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mathcad\\Mathcad 15\\doc\\funcdoc.  Functions and descriptions will then be available in the Mathcad 15 interface under Insert|Function or the Functions button on the toolbar.

* View if97_verification.xmcdz or if97_verification.pdf for examples of using the functions.

To Build
========

* You will need to have Visual Studio 2008 installed (Express version is fine).  Alternatively newer versions of Microsoft Visual Studio C++ should be fine, you'll just have to update the solution and project files

* Build the if97 DLL in Visual Studio.  The project will automatically copy the DLL and function documentation to the appropriate Mathcad installation directory.  You may have to allow user write access to both:

	``C:\Program Files (x86)\Mathcad\Mathcad 15\userefi``
	
    and
		
	``C:\Program Files (x86)\Mathcad\Mathcad 15\doc\funcdoc``

* Follow the above instructions for use.

Compiler Flags
==============

The Mathcad wrapper code uses the ``REGION3_ITERATE`` flag to provide more accurate (but slightly slower) calculation of density in Region 3 (mostly super-critical) and does not use the ``IAPWS_UNITS`` flag, leaving all input/output values in SI units.
